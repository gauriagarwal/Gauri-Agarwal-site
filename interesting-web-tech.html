        <h1>Interesting web technologies and frameworks</h1>
        <p>
          These are four up and coming web technologies and frameworks that I am
          fascinated by. Each one of them pushes the boundaries of what is
          possible in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          PWAs or Progressive Web Apps are web applications that make use of new
          and advanced features of a browser like push notifications and service
          workers to give an experience comparable to that of a native app.
        </p>
        <p>
          WebAssembly allow you to run code of languages like C, C++, and Rust
          in your web app along with JavaScript. This is very helpful in
          situations which are demanding like image processing. C++ code to
          process an image will run much fast than the pure JavaScript code to
          do the same things. Products and projects like Figma and Tensorflow.js
          are using to give a great experience to their users.
        </p>
        <p>
          WebXR allows developers to build VR and AR experiences for people. Now
          that mobile devices are coming more powerful and Internet is widely
          present, everyone will be able to enjoy VR and AR experiences
          conveniently from their browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          SvelteJS is a Javascript frontend library that makes it drastically
          simpler to make web applications. Its syntax is much simpler than that
          of React and Vue. It comes loaded with many great features like stores
          for easy communication between components and transitions to add
          delightful animations.
